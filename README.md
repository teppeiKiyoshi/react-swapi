# Fetch Data from Star Wars API

This is a simple ReactJS project to demonstrate how to connect to an API using built in functions like useCallback, useEffect, useState, to match with the async await functions. 

This project was possible through a Udemy course under Max about the complete guide of react, building from scratch.
